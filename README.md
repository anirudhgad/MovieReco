# Movie Recommendation System

## Summary
The recommender system recommends movies from a large collection based on user preferences. Users can specify their individual needs by specifying that they would like to narrow their recommendation by the genre, director, actors and year released.

The system recommends movies based of collaborative filtering.

The system is hosted entirely through Alexa Skills Kit, allowing users to request movies and specify preferences, and multiple AWS services such as API Gateway, Lambda and CloudSearch.

A typical conversation with the Alexa interface might look like this:

> Alexa
> Would you like to narrow your recommendation down by genre, director, or actor?
> User 1
> No 


## Setup


## Dataset
The final dataset is a combination of the [iMDB] (https://datasets.imdbws.com/) and [Netflix dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data?select=README)

iMDB provides multiple publicly available datasets. We used the following datasets:

- title.basics.tsv.gz (Contains information about movie titles)
- title.crew.tsv.gz (Contains information about directors and writers) 
- name.basics.tsv.gz (Contains further details about directors)
